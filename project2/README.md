# Iris Dataset
Read the Iris dataset and view the groups in all combinations of 2 out of 4
attributes. Each group must be marked with its respective color, and the
scatterplots must include color and/or brand legend. Apply k-neighbors in
these 2-by-2 configurations, reserving 25 cases of each category for training
and 25 for testing. Obtain, present and discuss briefly the performance for
each attribute setting using the respective matrices of confusion, which also
need to be presented.

To ease the data analysis and discussion we are going to use Python and Google
Colab in addition to github to store data eventually needed. The usage of
"ready" libraries is allowed except when it involves an important concept that
must the understanded.
